# Google Maps Weather Dashboard

An interactive weather dashboard that combines the **Google Maps API** and **OpenWeather API**.  
Users can click anywhere on the map to retrieve real‑time weather details for that location.  
This project demonstrates **API integration, asynchronous JavaScript, and DOM manipulation**.

## **Security Notes**
This project uses public API keys for Google Maps and OpenWeather.

- The **Google Maps API key** is **restricted** to the deployed GitHub Pages URL, so it cannot be used outside of this project.  
- The **OpenWeather API key** is included in the code for demonstration purposes. This key is free-tier and does not provide access to any sensitive information or billing features.

For production-level applications, API keys should be stored securely (e.g., environment variables or server-side proxies).
